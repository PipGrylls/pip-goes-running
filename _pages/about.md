I am a distinctly average runner for 'someone who runs'.
Nothing in the blog consitutes advice as it is highly likely I am doing somthing wrong.
I started this blog after completing my first Ultramarathon and thought having a place to collect my thoughts and track my feelings about training would be a good idea.
It also spares my friends and family from dealing with my stream of conciouness and desire to talk out my running thoughts.
I intend to do a weekly log, race/event _rundowns_ (pun thoughrougly intended), and do some webscraping from my garmin/parkrun profile to make the site _run_ smoothly.
I may also do random posts about running gear that is either new to me or I am retiringing to help me track my thoughts to make better purchasing decisions in the future.
