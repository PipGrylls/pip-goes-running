> Since the last post my training was:
>
> Strength training, hitting the big muscles and then doing core.
>
> Warmup run to Parkrun, 5:08 pace Zone 3 for 50\% time
>
> Coventry Parkrun 23:03 (New shoes)
>
> 11k run with 2kg pack weight, 5:26 Zone 2 for 89\% of the time
>
> Full body strength (post run)

Strength training night before and then a Zone 3 run before parkrun was way too much.
Then the sun came out half a km into parkrun, so did a 23min.

HOWEVER:
I was using some new shoes for my warmup to and Parkrun, Hoka Rocket X.
They are clearly very good shoes and part of why I got excited and ran quickly there.
I am weighing up getting a 2nd pair as they are cheap atm, I will give them another Parkrun and see where I am at.
