### Back after a bit...

December was a bit of a dead zone, January has been mostly about doing 'base runs' and not knackering my knees.

After my Forerunner 645 broke I got a Fenix 7s and it gives me a breakdown of Anerobic, High Aerobic, and Low Areobic load.
My High Aerobic load was consistently too high so Ive been running to improve base until that normalized then building in a couple of post long run anerobic sprints alongside the gym. This has helped a lot.

Today I did a test marathon to see where I was at ahead of Oulton in march, I think 3:30:00 is off the cards but 3:45:00 is possible all other things being well.
Lessons learnt today is that I find a wall at 30km and then another one at 37.2km.
I 100% ignored the received wisdom that you will go out to fast but it got me half PB and I still got sub 4 hours so alls well and better to get that out my system now.
Plan for Oulton is to go out at 5:15-5:20 min per kilometer and try and hold it.

The races for the year are set as I've added an october 110km run starting on the 4th October, this will be a just finish event but if I can get in under 20h I think thats a win.
