Definatly feeling the hike from last weekend and an underlying cold or somthing.
Most exorcises I have post evaluated as feeling weaker, difficulty/exersion have felt about normal however.

Total km this week was 47.5km which is on the upper end of expected. Knees are medium, legs are good, feet are medium. Next week I will push for 55-60km.
