I think i will miss the 7 hour goal by up to an hour, keeping it down to 7:30 would be ideal.
I havent had time, i.e. forgot to make time, to practice nutrition.
I'm going with sis gels and kp nuts which I used before and I know doesn't mess me up.
Late addition may be some snack bars.

Kit for this one is more intense:

- Proper Bivvy
- First Aid
- Map and compass
- Headlamp, phone, whistle
- Warm gloves (ronhill with waterproof mitten covers)
- Warm hat, and cap for if it ranins and I want to keep it off my face, sunglasses for morning glare.
- Nike pro base layer, backup runderware base layer second layer tech T
- Runderware boxers (tried y-fronts would use the, for a cold up to half but rub too much to do any more than that)
- Gymshark leggigns and ronhill shorts
- Tecton X and sealskin high socks.
- Higher state mac, OMM waterproof trowsers.
- OMM waistbelt (snacks), OMM Ultravest5 (water and kit)
- 12 gels (1 every 40 mins so 8 hours carb), 250g peanuts, maybe 2 dark chocolate snack bars.
- 2L Water backpack, 2x 500ml Water with electrolites, 2x top up electorlite tabs for on route top up.

Excluding water this should be just over 2kg with water it jumps to 5kg.
