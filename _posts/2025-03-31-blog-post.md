## Bath 50

I ran the Bath 50km race by Ultra Challenge. I came 20th out of a roughly 1000 strong field finishing in 5:22:35.
This race was started and ended at Lansdown racecourse it descended into bath went over Odd Down seeming simply to punish up by going back up to Coombe Down.
After this it was back down the hill to the canal and a thankfully flat 10km to Batheaston, then two sharp climbs before a flat couple of kilometers to return to the racecourse.
I had hoped for a sub 5 hour but reasonable I don't think I am there yet, I need far stronger hill skill both ascent and descent.
I also had issues with my IT band (LHS) which flared up on one of the early descents, I managed to power on along the canal but by the last two climbs and particularly the final descent I was moving very slowly.

I'm going to work on that IT band now as its effected me on the BYU and now this, next up is pacing the Stratford marathon at 4:00:00 so hopefully it holds for that.
