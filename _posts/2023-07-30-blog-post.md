The standout here is the half which is a new PB.
It felt strong especially in the 2nd half but it should be noted running south on the greenway is all downhill which has definatly factored into the 10k and half PBs.
The other thing to note is the intervals and hill reps despite feeling like I am at a limit are showing up as 2.9/5 Anerobic efforts.
I will run a lactate threshold guided calabration to try to get a new HR band reading soon, which should show me if this is acurate or hangover from when my HR used to redline at 200 at 5min/k.
Im happy with this week, running a half is probably unsustaniable so I am thinking of going for once a month.
