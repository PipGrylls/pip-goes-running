Easy week training, with a short walking holiday.
New clifton 9s for all the running.
They seem very good less energy return than the plates but the foam is springy and the ride is comfortable.

Total running was 18.5km, then many many hours on foot with lots of weight hiking.
Next week shooting for 35km to 50km.
