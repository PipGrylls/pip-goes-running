It was RSECon this week so no midweek proper gym and also I ate too much/slept too little.
Getting in both speed sessions was good and the 15km trail run was great, got me looking forward to the peak district in November.

The main battle this week was with the heat, even waking up early for runs it was still 18+ degrease and 70%+ humididty.
Runners leg day was less intense then I thought it would be, but I was also at what I would have had as mu maximum weight for those exorcises.
I think I could stand to improve my form on everything but the squats and split squats inparticular.

Back into easy week now, I will be pacing Lizzie for Rugby half to get her in under 2:10 as it dosent fall on my schedule to have a taper before it so there isn't much chance of a fast time for me anyway.
